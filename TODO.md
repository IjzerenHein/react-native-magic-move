- [ ] Fix elasticity on new AnimationClone (fix clamping on interpolate)
- [ ] Optimize AnimationClone to ignore non animated props (deal with this efficiently)
- [ ] Native target is sometimes briefly visible when animation starts
- [ ] Transform (e.g. rotateZ) are not respected?
- [ ] ShrinkAndGrow transition does the funky chicken on Android (seems like a bug in RN)
- [ ] Blur effects
- [ ] Scene transitions

Transition ideas:

- [ ] Batman transition (rotateZ, blur, zoom)
- [ ] Zoom-in to new scene, while zooming out and blurring the existing scene (creates a depth effect)
- [ ] Blend background into foreground and vice versa
- [ ] Tilized animations
